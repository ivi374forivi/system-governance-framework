- **Challenges**: Coordination complexity, potential inconsistency

### 3. Hybrid Governance
- **Structure**: Combination of centralized and federated approaches
- **Best For**: Complex organizations with varied needs
- **Benefits**: Flexibility, optimized control
- **Challenges**: Design complexity, change management
